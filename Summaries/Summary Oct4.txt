Buble sort, Selection sort both got same complexity O(N^2) because in the end of each iteration you fix 1 element
Insertion - compares element with next element, if bigger, changes place, if smaller, moves forward
Even in best case selection has n^2 complexity because doing all comparisons and fixings
Insertion has n complexity in best case scenario
I can't summarize merge but I understand it)))
First part of merge has complexity of log2 n
Sexond part of merge has complexity of n
