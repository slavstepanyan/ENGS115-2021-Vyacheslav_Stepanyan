Merge function has subfundtions inside of it
For example it has 8 elements. it will devided it to 4(1) and 4(2) at first
Then it will devide 4(1) to 2(1) and 2(2)
After that devide 2(1) to 1(1) and 1(2) and compare those. After it will return and then get back to 2(2) and work with that logic for all array
