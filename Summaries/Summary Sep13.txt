Array/vector (Random access Container) -> Double linked list (Reverse Container) -> Single Linked list (Forward Container) -> Container
STL library became part of C++
If need to add element to array, need to allocate new memory with n+1 space, copy array and free the old memory space
Complexity of adding element to array is O(N+1+1+1) => O O(N)
